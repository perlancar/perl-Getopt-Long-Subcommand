0.103   2019-02-27 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Bump prereq version Getopt::Long 0 -> 2.50 because
	  versions between 2.43 (inclusive) and 2.50 (exclusive) is
	  incompatible with us [RT#128643] [thanks Eric 'ikegami' Brine].


0.102   2017-08-12 (PERLANCAR)

	- Comment-out Log::ger because we broke
	  Perinci::CmdLine::Inline-based scripts which do not expect us to
	  use Log::ger.


0.101   2017-08-01 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Catch a couple more constant-in-grep bugs (thanks
	  perlcritic).


0.100   2017-08-01 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add cmdspec 'configure' to allow customizing Getopt::Long
          configuration (including in specific subcommands only). Thanks to
          Mario Zieschang.

        - Add some tests.

        - Replace Log::Any with Log::ger, reinstate logging statements.


0.09    2017-01-06 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add specification key: default_subcommand.

        - Allow option handler to set subcommand name via $_[2]{subcommand}
          instead of having to always take subcommand from first element of
          @ARGV.


0.08    2017-01-06 (PERLANCAR)

	- Provide workaround $res->{_non_options_argv} to option handler so
	  it can extract subcommand name from it when otherwise the
	  subcommand name has been specified and consumed by Getopt::Long
	  from @ARGV.

	- [Incompatible change] Allow subcommand being unspecified, don't
	  regard it as a fail (success=0), but as a success.


0.07    2017-01-03 (PERLANCAR)

        - Remove experimental label.

        - Remove use of experimental.pm and Log::Any::IfLOG to reduce deps.

        - Workaround issue in Getopt::Long where gnu_compat disables bundling as
          a side effect, so we enable bundling after gnu_compat (ref:
          [RT#119165]).


0.06    2016-12-02 (PERLANCAR)

	- Set Getopt::Long configuration no_getopt_compat & gnu_compat.

0.04    2015-12-30 (PERLANCAR)

	  convenience, like in Perinci::Sub::Complete &
	  Getopt::Long::Complete.

	- Bump prereq version Log::Any::IfLOG to 0.07.


0.03    2015-03-09 (PERLANCAR)

        - [Incompatible change] 'subcommand' passed to completion routine is now
          an array instead of string.
